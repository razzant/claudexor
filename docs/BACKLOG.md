# Backlog

Explicitly deferred work with a recorded owner decision. Rule: an item leaves
this file only by shipping or by an owner decision recorded in its row.
Silent drops are the failure mode this file exists to prevent — the 2.1.0
audit found ten F2.5 leftovers that were neither shipped nor consciously
deferred; they are recorded here now.

## Owner-review wave 1 leftovers (2.1.0 accounts scope; NITs recorded per ship rule)

- E3: a preflight-rotated default-subject profile is invisible to router
  cooldown/metric subjects (`profileAuthRoute`/`credentialSubjectId` key on the
  pinned id only). Opt-in path; no billing misvaluation possible.
- E4: `registerConfigDirProfile` creates the login dir before the locked config
  write (orphan dir on duplicate refusal) and maps 409 via message matching.
- E5: an idempotent setup-job create replay re-validates the profile, so a
  since-deleted profile 400s instead of returning the prior job (fail-closed).
- E6: the profile verification probe does not re-check `enabled` mid-job; run
  routing still refuses disabled profiles.
- N1: 4xx problem bodies from thrown service errors carry `code:
  "internal_error"` (message/status correct) — pre-existing serializer pattern.
- N4: no recorded macOS Visual QA evidence pass for the accounts popover yet;
  owner is dogfooding the surface live.

## Delete-accounts wave leftovers (5ad0f1e7 review; NITs/WARNs per ship rule)

- W3: `deleteCredentialProfile`'s 409 login guard is check-then-act (a login
  job created between guard and removal loses its dir mid-login), and an
  actively RUNNING run pinned to the profile is not guarded. Both residues
  fail loudly downstream (probe/vendor process errors); no silent corruption.
- N2: CLI `profiles remove|login` funnel server refusals through
  `printUsageError` (exit 2), conflating usage errors with daemon refusals;
  body text is preserved verbatim. Mixed precedent with `secrets delete`.
- R4-5: the app's delete notice renders a disclosed `cleanupWarning`
  (row removed, orphan dir) in the same failure-red style as a 409 refusal
  (row stays); server text carries the truth verbatim. UX polish.
- R4-6: retargeting the open AuthSheet at a profile bypasses the
  close-confirmation dialog for an ACTIVE default login job; the replacement
  sheet immediately re-attaches to the same job (harness-scoped recovery) and
  a second login stays blocked — nothing is lost or unobserved.

## Release machinery retirement (owner decision, 2.1.0 release)

- Delete the retired six-slot release-review machinery after v2.1.0 ships:
  `scripts/seal-release-review-attestation.mjs`,
  `scripts/lib/release-review-attestation.mjs` (+ `.d.mts`),
  `scripts/triad-scope-review.mjs` / `scripts/lib/openrouter-panel.mjs`,
  the v2 branch of `validateReleaseAttestation`
  (schemaVersion-2 payload/panel-lock/slot validators in
  `scripts/lib/release-review-contract.mjs`), and their fixtures/tests.
  Blocked until: the first schemaVersion-3-attested release is published (the
  burned 2.1.0/2.1.1 npm flights moved the version; see CHECKLISTS
  "Owner-review release protocol").

## Deferred from the v3 plan itself (sol triage #13/#34)

- HarnessLogo overlay everywhere (old W27) — cosmetics, after 2.1.0.
- M7 reasoning-segment closing-block timer; M11 remainder (`file://`
  host/percent-encoding); E11 usage snapshot-vs-delta discriminator.
- Codex proto-mode for smooth deltas; codex `rateLimitResetCredits` mini-gap.

## F2.5 leftovers surfaced by the 2.1.0 audit (previously untriaged)

- C1: CLI live-printer double-prints codex narration+final (dedup fix exists
  on an unmerged branch).
- C2: `claudexor follow` reports "stream ended without a terminal event" on
  some successful runs.
- C3: cancelling a QUEUED run emits no head ping / `enqueue_error` — the
  thread view can miss the cancellation.
- E1: fd-based no-follow TOCTOU closure for scoped file serving.
- E2: daemon↔app protocol version handshake/negotiation.
- E3: engine-typed `queuedAt`/`startedAt`/`terminalAt` timestamps.
- E4: producer-side byte/latency delta coalescing.
- E5: denyPaths native pre-write enforcement (gated on claude ≥2.1.208).
- P13: dead `TaskRun.isLive` / `ProvenanceTag "Sample"` knobs left from the
  demo-mode removal.

## Deferred during the 2.1.0 release loop (decision recorded per row)

- Profile-policy `ask` interactive UX (see `docs/FEATURES.md` row).
- macOS credential-profile management beyond the 2.1.0 picker scope: full
  in-app login flow for ADDING a profile end-to-end (the 2.1.0 app ships
  list + picker + guided add via `claudexor profiles login`).
- Thread-scoped run creation via POST /runs: preflight refusals happen
  before the turn exists, unlike the turns route (round-18 scope advisory;
  see `docs/FEATURES.md` row).
- raw-API profile bootstrap when the instance key is absent (ARCHITECTURE
  Design constraint; revisit only if raw-API instances get profile demand).
