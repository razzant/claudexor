# Changelog

Release history for Claudexor. The current version is declared in the root
`package.json` (the version SSOT); tags `v*` correspond to GitHub Releases.

- **v0.14.1** — checkpoint hardening for explicit reviewer panels, mandatory
  review evidence preflight, scoped Cursor reviewer readiness, frozen SpecPack
  gate merging, protected-path approvals, and thin control/macOS projection
  parity.
- **v0.14.0** — battery-driven hardening: typed transient retry evidence,
  configurable reviewer timeouts with stronger route-proof capture,
  `stuck_no_progress` convergence diagnostics, deterministic protected-path
  tamper blocking, and a stricter real-harness battery with ENV quarantine.
- **v0.13.3** — harness-agnostic hardening: a contract-level attempt outcome
  model, unified runtime PATH handling, adapter-declared credential/isolation
  capabilities, uniform mandatory-context behavior across harnesses,
  sandbox-safe secrets, deterministic fakes, and an honest CLI surface.
- **v0.13.2** — Canvas + node_repl fix: the Canvas Artifacts panel now shows the
  PROJECT's produced outputs (the repo `artifacts/` dir, served via
  `GET /runs/:id/produced`, images inline, the Browser tab auto-renders the
  project `index.html`) — distinct from Run Detail's run-internal artifact tree;
  and Codex.app's inherited `node_repl` MCP, which can't run headless and failed
  otherwise-clean runs, is now disabled config-aware (only when it is actually
  defined in the config codex loads — never on a scoped home, which avoids an
  "invalid transport" config-load break).
- **v0.13.1** — attachment fix: user-attached images now reach the model
  (orchestrator forwards attachments in every run path; the codex adapter
  terminates the variadic `-i` with `--` so the prompt survives), an image-bearing
  run only routes to vision-capable harnesses (or fails loudly), and large
  agent-produced images render in the gallery.
- **v0.13.0** — interactive workbench: composer attachments + in-app screenshots,
  an artifacts gallery + mini-browser in a Canvas/Workbench, a deeper multi-tier
  spec interview, a multi-harness planning relay, and an agent-driven browser
  (Playwright MCP).
- **v0.12.1** — fix release after v0.12.0: embed the SwiftPM-generated resource
  bundle in the release macOS app so the packaged app works outside the build
  checkout.
- **v0.12.0** — restored the write/apply path (codex transcript route-proof,
  scoped homes) and honesty fixes.
- **v0.11.0** — host plugin lifecycle: `claudexor plugin` now manages
  user-global Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode integrations with
  generated skill/MCP artifacts plus command artifacts where the host supports
  them, ownership state, dry-run/status/doctor/repair/uninstall flows, Codex
  personal-marketplace registration, OpenCode skill/command/experimental
  JS-plugin/MCP wiring, and install-health checks that keep host integration
  readiness separate from harness doctor readiness.
- **v0.10.2** — real interactive spec quiz (multiple-choice interview) and the
  frosted-glass backdrop refinement.
- **v0.10.1** — macOS UX fixes and the first interactive spec flow.
- **v0.10.0** — chat-first macOS beta: one-screen thread list, conversation,
  and inspector; in-place thread turns; honest run outcomes; static
  behind-window glass replacing the old animated mesh.
- **v0.9.0** — chat/session-first + harness-agnostic truth: modes collapse 9→5
  (`ask`/`plan`/`audit`/`agent`/`orchestrate`; strategies are flags); threads
  with native session resume across read-only turns (codex `exec resume`,
  claude `--resume`; write turns run fresh envelopes with a typed
  `session.rebound` disclosure) plus a no-args CLI REPL; subscription auth pass-through into
  envelopes (native codex/claude sessions work with NO API key) with both auth
  routes and auto-fallback; typed operator decisions unblock NEEDS_HUMAN runs
  through the apply gate (patch-hash-bound, audited); the `orchestrate` brain
  intent (routed like reviewers, typed tool-belt plan); survival fixes (diff vs
  base_sha so committed harness work is never lost, untracked-inclusive
  snapshots, branch GC, process-group kills, mid-flight budget caps, reviewer
  timeout spend, codex cached-token cost, honest acceptance/tie evidence,
  expanded secret redaction); doctor probe TTL cache; MCP protocol bump with
  doctor-honest status + repo-path input; ACP editor-cwd + free-text answers;
  cursor/opencode resume + unified provider env scrub; OpenRouter raw-api
  instance; macOS ThreadsScreen (chat-first) with decision/apply actions on
  turns and a lifted dark card recipe.
- **v0.8.0** — live truth pass: event-sourced streaming with a monotonic
  per-run `seq` and snapshot-then-subscribe SSE (gap-free reconnects, byte-level
  parser in the macOS app), interactive runs (`waiting_on_user`) with Claude's
  bidirectional control protocol live-verified (`AskUserQuestion` answered from
  the app, CLI `claudexor follow`, ACP), automatic git initialization for
  write-mode runs on non-git folders (seeded `.gitignore` + announced baseline
  commit), orchestrator honesty fixes (no corpse review/synthesis spend,
  root-cause `failure.yaml`, `output.ready` before terminal events, no vacuous
  `tests=100%`), in-process setup doctor (exit-127 class removed), observed-model
  route proof, global `GET /events` multiplex, configurable interaction timeout,
  and the frosted floating-card design doctrine across both themes.
- **v0.7.0** — engine truth pass: typed `tool_call`/`tool_result` events with a
  shared adapter run loop, engine-owned `final/telemetry.yaml` evidence, web
  policy as a manifest capability with disclosed upgrades, parallel
  race/explore, user-level trust gating for full access, per-harness settings
  enforced engine-wide (enabled/model/effort/web in the macOS editor; budget,
  turn/round caps, and tool lists via config and the settings API), typed
  risk/protected-path review gates, honest control-api/daemon lifecycles,
  macOS live streams + diff tab + per-harness settings editor,
  knip/docs-truth/conformance CI gates,
  dead subsystem deletions (ExecutionEngine, legacy in-proc control server,
  `/runs/:id/input` stub).
- **v0.6.0** — first public beta: canonical modes, daemon + control API, macOS
  app, review/arbitration pipeline, secret store, release automation.

Tags before v0.6.0 (v0.1.0–v0.5.0) were internal pre-beta milestones and are
not documented here.
