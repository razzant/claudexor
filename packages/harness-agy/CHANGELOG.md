### Patch Changes

- 8bae6ae: Credential-shaped text in your own work is no longer refused or masked (#555, INV-146 retires INV-062). A review brief, prompt, instruction, output schema, test command, live or deferred message, interaction answer or attachment that contains a bearer header, an `sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA` key, a JWT or a PEM block now reaches the selected harness exactly; the typed `inline_secret_rejected` error is gone from the CLI, `POST /v2/runs`, thread turns, MCP and ACP. The task contract, command journal, served job params, thread history, events, SSE frames, answers, plans, reports, retained output, saved `patch.diff` copies, reviewer packets, reviewer workspaces, context packs and served artifacts keep the exact bytes, so Exact Retry, Run Again, continuation and later turns read back what was sent, and reviewers judge the same patch apply uses. Files named `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/…`, `.ssh/…` or `.claude/…` inside the project are ordinary project files for context, review, directory results, uploads and served outputs; Codex approval requests for them are offered instead of declined, and `review --diff` no longer refuses a diff. Claude `AskUserQuestion` text is shown exactly and answered by its native question text. Tool calls keep unmasked targets (command, path, query, URL) within each adapter's existing bounds, and tool results keep unmasked summaries of their output (`content_summary`, and a failed tool's own `error_summary`, within each adapter's existing bound and whitespace normalization) for every adapter, a Cursor shell command whose end is unconfirmed keeps its complete native result (`native_result`) exactly, a failed raw-API completion keeps the model's bounded partial output (`partial_output`) exact in its error event while it stays a failure, never becomes the answer and the provider's error report stays masked, a Copilot ACP answer keeps credential-shaped text exact (only the managed token Claudexor injected is removed), a work report's required inputs stay exact in telemetry and run facts, a planner's own `plans/<harness>.md` copy is its exact text, and the gate argv disclosed to a candidate is the argv the gate runner executes. Images are no longer withheld from `produced/` or from served outputs for their bytes; an image Claudexor did not save (over the per-image or total size cap, unreadable, a link, not a regular file or an unsafe path) is listed in the attempt's `produced_omitted` with its size and reason, and the run summary names it. Credentials Claudexor itself owns stay in their stores, outside every worktree, behind daemon authentication, grants, read-only and trust policy, root and symlink containment and digest checks; engine diagnostics (errors, stderr tails, probe output, vendor failure reports, also inside the run, attempt and reviewer event journals, which all pass through one masking step) are still masked. Claudexor never places its engine credentials into prompts, events or artifacts; a harness process can read the credential the engine hands it, and whatever the harness prints is ordinary output kept exactly in local run records, as in the vendor's own transcript. Importing an arbitrary host file still refuses credential-store paths, and review risk still rates credential-named paths critical. The historical release-attestation sealer no longer refuses a reviewer report or metadata file for credential-shaped text: it still requires strict UTF-8, the digest and exact-key bindings and its other checks, and the attestation carries digests and validated fields, never report text. A real key you put in working content is ordinary task material: it reaches the selected model and stays in local run records. Runs written by earlier versions keep their masked copies; their `persisted_patch: redacted` patches still apply only from the private exact object (`patch_exact_bytes_unavailable` when it is missing), and the MCP read tools still project their `secretLike` disclosure, which is `null` for new runs.

  **Breaking:** `pr` delivery now needs the pinned open-source scanner Betterleaks 1.9.0 and checks what would leave the machine with it instead of Claudexor's own patterns; an npm-installed CLI bundles no scanner, so its `pr` refuses with `publication_scan_unavailable` until one is provided (below). Before any branch, index or ref changes, the exact outgoing commit, every earlier commit that a URL `git push origin` sends to (its push URL when one is set) does not already advertise, read with `git ls-remote` (a secret added and later deleted included, and a commit only the fetch URL or another remote holds still counts), what each merge in that range itself changed (Git's remerge view, Git 2.36 or newer: a conflict resolution or an "evil" merge, never content its parents already carried; an octopus merge has no such view and is scanned for what it adds over its first parent, which can re-flag content a non-first parent already published), the commit messages of that range, the branch name and the PR title and body are scanned with live validation off; the PR body `gh` reads is the scanned copy, and the push sends exactly the scanned commit object. A finding refuses typed (`publication_scan_findings`, rule and place only, never the matched text; a file name or label the scanner itself flags is shown as `withheld location (sha256 …)`, and every place is withheld when that check cannot run); a missing or unpinned scanner (`publication_scan_unavailable`) and a scan that fails, times out, writes no valid report or reads a Git history that Git's own trace2 record does not prove complete (every `git log` it ran exited 0 without a signal; a `git log` killed mid-stream otherwise looks clean) (`publication_scan_failed`) also refuse, and local apply, branch and commit stay available. The outgoing repository's own `.gitleaksignore`/`.betterleaksignore`, inline allow comments and scanner environment variables cannot suppress a finding. The macOS app and its update closure now bundle the darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64 builds and each SSH runtime archive bundles its own target's build, with the MIT license and provenance (the SBOMs list them). npm installs, and hosts on other platforms embedding the closure, bundle none for their platform: point `CLAUDEXOR_BETTERLEAKS_PATH` at the pinned build or provision it with `node scripts/provision-betterleaks.mjs`. Delivery never downloads it. Betterleaks skips some binary, archive and lockfile content by design, so a clean scan is not proof that nothing sensitive is present. Repository CI and release use the same adapter in place of the old `git grep` step, over the range's commits, merges and messages and the tracked tree; a release being published also scans its annotated tag's message.

## 4.8.2

### Patch Changes

- bd69a20: Antigravity runs can now read files outside their workspace folder. Readonly runs mapped to agy's plan mode, which asks before such a read; a headless run cannot answer, so agy refused the read and usually ended the turn without an answer. On a production install about half of readonly agy runs failed this way, while claude and codex readonly runs almost never did. The adapter now ensures the profile's own `settings.json` allows `read_file(*)`, which the vendor documents as matching all files on the system, before every run and keeps all other settings, so agy reads like the other harnesses; write confinement is unchanged. A `read_file` deny rule in that file still wins, and `toolPermission: "strict"` still prompts before every read. Settings the adapter cannot read, parse or write are left alone and a non-full run reports `agy_read_grant_unavailable`. Plan mode still has no approved shell path, so the instructions of a readonly run now end with an engine note that shell commands are unavailable, recorded as an `agy_readonly_access_note` status, instead of letting a refused command end the run.

## 4.8.0

### Patch Changes

- 6c31c44: Add the Grok Build subscription CLI harness: named accounts with isolated
  profile homes, device login, account model lists, shared effort placement,
  stream parsing and reactive quota cooldowns for pools and rotation. Readiness
  comes from `grok models` in the profile env, and an inconclusive probe stays
  unknown instead of marking the account dead; failure text from a run is never
  read as an authentication verdict either. Session login is confirmed from
  Grok's init frame; a contradicting source fails the attempt as the new typed
  `credential_source_unconfirmed` request refusal, without a retry or account
  rotation, even when the same frame also contradicts the scoped tool policy.
  Claudexor never selects an API key, but a key in Grok's own configuration can
  send a paid request before that check, as the adapter README discloses.
  Subscription cash is reported unknown, not zero. Grok joins the macOS Add Account picker and
  the shared credential-store path rules, so a directory run never copies or
  publishes a selected `.grok/` directory; leave it out of `--scope-path`. An app
  built before this change cannot decode an active Grok login job, and its
  engine-update check reports busy until that login finishes or is cancelled.
  Applied attempt facts now name the HOME a Grok, Antigravity or Cursor profile
  child actually received.

## 4.7.0

### Patch Changes

- 74fb275: Add `execution.auxiliaryWritableRoots`: exact caller-created service directories (a shared download cache, outside-Git scratch) an Agent run with effective `workspace_write` may also write. Admission records the canonical list in `TaskContract.access.auxiliary_writable_roots` and refuses unsafe, missing or conflicting grants with typed codes, including any overlap with the execution or source tree. Lanes negotiate it through `capability_profile.access_control.auxiliary_writable_roots` and the catalog's `accessControl.auxiliaryWritableRoots`: Codex applies it per turn through its native sandbox policy; a new turn with no roots drops the earlier grant, while `continueFrom` with no execution group inherits the predecessor's whole group. Other adapters refuse an explicit pool and drop from Auto. The CLI gains repeatable `--auxiliary-writable-root`; MCP run tools, `claudexor_thread_turn` and ACP carry the same member.

## 4.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 2593b90: On Windows, background harness runs and captures start the vendor with an invisible
  console instead of none, so the shells, `git`, MCP servers and other console programs
  a run starts inherit it instead of opening windows of their own. Agy keeps the
  console-less start because its print mode treats an openable console input as
  interactive, and Claudexor's own `git` calls keep the console-less start they always
  had.
  Cancellation still stops the whole tree with `taskkill /T`, and a background child
  now also ends when the daemon process dies. The no-Terminal sign-in
  children (URL disclosure and the device-code app-server) open no console window, and
  Codex quota and model discovery, the install version proof and the `login --help`
  probe start their direct child hidden. The Node preload that defaulted `windowsHide`
  inside npm wrappers is removed: the inherited console covers those children.

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Ordinary Codex Fast (`fast`/`priority`) on a verified ChatGPT subscription is included service under no-paid routing and every cash cap, including `finite(0)`; verified Codex subscription work now reports its cash as unknown (`spendUsd` and `budget_summary.spend_usd` null, cost basis `debit: "unobserved"`) beside the cap-governed `controllableSpendUsd` instead of exact zero, and without a preference keeps the first account's chosen speed across retries, Exact Retry, rotation and continuation (#468, thanks @IlidanNaga). Codex catalogs keep a declared `inputModalities` list only when it is wholly valid and non-empty, as metadata that gates no request (#435, thanks @josephsteuerjr). The opt-in `GET /v2/quota?view=resources_freshness` view adds a required `availability_scope` echo, Cursor accounts report dated display-only monetary resources from Cursor's internal dashboard through the existing refresh cycle, and Antigravity's native headless permission auto-denial becomes typed `permission_denial` evidence without retry or access elevation (#467).

  Codex workspace-write uses native on-request with auto_review by default and an explicit one-action retry handback; HTTP/MCP can revise the existing live soft/hard timer, and configuration can disable only inactivity timing with null (#466, thanks @IlidanNaga). This adds no session-wide grant, readonly bypass, automatic retry authorization by Claudexor, per-run idle field or installed CLI update; timers are not restored after daemon loss and native UI/vendor qualification remains limited.

## 3.21.0

### Patch Changes

- 7c541ba: One effort word now works on Cursor and Antigravity too, where the level is a token of the compound model id. Given an effort preference, the adapter's preparation selects the listed level variant of the requested model's family from the inventory of the account that will run (`grok-4.7-high` + `max` runs the listed `grok-4.7-xhigh`; `gemini-3.8-flash-low` + `max` runs `gemini-3.8-flash-high`): the family is the id with exactly one shared-order level token removed, `fast` and `thinking` stay in the family key so the choice never crosses fast/standard or thinking/no-thinking, a family exists only when the account lists two or more levels, and the level is placed by the shared preference order alone. One preparation yields the final id (the processing receipt's `submittedNative`, which is the `--model` argument) and the effort receipt (`parameter: --model`, `submitted` = level token), recorded once per spawn and per reviewer dispatch; the requested id stays in the model hint and in `attempts[].requested_model`. Nothing new refuses: an unknown word, an ambiguous id, a family-less id or an empty account list keep the id unchanged with an `omitted` receipt and a note. Antigravity rewrites only from the pinned account's live `agy models` list; the static hint list never authorizes a rewrite. Settings writes accept the preference for these routes, the existing fast-pair and paid policy run after the level choice, and the final telemetry `model_mismatch` compares the observation with the id actually sent.
- a4ff572: Reconcile older quota refusals with newer account observations, preserve genuine credential rejections without duplicating poller state, and pace quota reads per affected account. Ordinary Accounts and account-catalog reads retain their first observation instead of repeatedly probing vendors. Discover Antigravity models for the selected account, forward explicitly requested unlisted models with disclosure, and preserve known quota-family applicability for new model IDs.

### Patch Changes

- 386bbf1: Add the Gemini 3.8 Flash model definitions (gemini-3.8-flash-high, gemini-3.8-flash-medium, gemini-3.8-flash-low) to the Antigravity known-model list. The verified CLI version stays 1.1.13, the version the recorded fixtures were captured against: the three ids were confirmed live with `agy models` under a Claudexor profile HOME on 2026-10-03 (the host agy answered 1.1.13 right before the listing and self-updated to 1.2.16 during it), which is evidence of the ids on the vendor backend, not a fixture re-verification.

- Keep Antigravity model and quota checks non-interactive by closing piped input instead of using a null device. Preserve ambiguous authentication timeouts as probe failures and expose failed refreshes alongside stale quota data.

## 3.8.1

### Patch Changes

- ce6dba1: Prepare an isolated macOS keychain inside each Antigravity credential profile before vendor probes, quota reads, logins, and runs. The vendor's existing file fallback and profile separation remain unchanged.
- 2794ec7: Remove the engine-owned outer Seatbelt wrapper and restore each harness's
  native access policy. Delegated mutating runs now keep stable project identity
  separate from their disposable execution workspace, active requests use
  `readonly`, `workspace_write`, or explicitly trusted `full`, and historical
  outer-confinement artifacts remain readable without enabling new retired-mode
  runs.

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2316ef8: Add the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a harness, so a Google AI Pro/Ultra
  subscription runs through Claudexor like the other vendor CLIs.

  Named Google identities are Claudexor-owned profile HOMEs (`config_dir_login`),
  so several subscriptions stay signed in side by side without touching the
  operator's real home or login keychain. `claudexor quota` reads each profile's
  own `/quota` windows, and the windows are model-scoped: exhausting the Gemini
  budget does not block the account's Claude/GPT slugs. `claudexor harness
install agy` downloads Google's official installer in full, prints its size and
  sha256, and runs the file you were shown — it is never piped into a shell.

  The vendor exposes no config-dir environment variable, so the profile HOME also
  holds its conversation and cache state, and it publishes no machine-readable
  account identity — both are disclosed rather than papered over. Windows support
  is best effort in this release.
