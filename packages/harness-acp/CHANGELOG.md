### Patch Changes

- 8bae6ae: Credential-shaped text in your own work is no longer refused or masked (#555, INV-146 retires INV-062). A review brief, prompt, instruction, output schema, test command, live or deferred message, interaction answer or attachment that contains a bearer header, an `sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA` key, a JWT or a PEM block now reaches the selected harness exactly; the typed `inline_secret_rejected` error is gone from the CLI, `POST /v2/runs`, thread turns, MCP and ACP. The task contract, command journal, served job params, thread history, events, SSE frames, answers, plans, reports, retained output, saved `patch.diff` copies, reviewer packets, reviewer workspaces, context packs and served artifacts keep the exact bytes, so Exact Retry, Run Again, continuation and later turns read back what was sent, and reviewers judge the same patch apply uses. Files named `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/…`, `.ssh/…` or `.claude/…` inside the project are ordinary project files for context, review, directory results, uploads and served outputs; Codex approval requests for them are offered instead of declined, and `review --diff` no longer refuses a diff. Claude `AskUserQuestion` text is shown exactly and answered by its native question text. Tool calls keep unmasked targets (command, path, query, URL) within each adapter's existing bounds, and tool results keep unmasked summaries of their output (`content_summary`, and a failed tool's own `error_summary`, within each adapter's existing bound and whitespace normalization) for every adapter, a Cursor shell command whose end is unconfirmed keeps its complete native result (`native_result`) exactly, a failed raw-API completion keeps the model's bounded partial output (`partial_output`) exact in its error event while it stays a failure, never becomes the answer and the provider's error report stays masked, a Copilot ACP answer keeps credential-shaped text exact (only the managed token Claudexor injected is removed), a work report's required inputs stay exact in telemetry and run facts, a planner's own `plans/<harness>.md` copy is its exact text, and the gate argv disclosed to a candidate is the argv the gate runner executes. Images are no longer withheld from `produced/` or from served outputs for their bytes; an image Claudexor did not save (over the per-image or total size cap, unreadable, a link, not a regular file or an unsafe path) is listed in the attempt's `produced_omitted` with its size and reason, and the run summary names it. Credentials Claudexor itself owns stay in their stores, outside every worktree, behind daemon authentication, grants, read-only and trust policy, root and symlink containment and digest checks; engine diagnostics (errors, stderr tails, probe output, vendor failure reports, also inside the run, attempt and reviewer event journals, which all pass through one masking step) are still masked. Claudexor never places its engine credentials into prompts, events or artifacts; a harness process can read the credential the engine hands it, and whatever the harness prints is ordinary output kept exactly in local run records, as in the vendor's own transcript. Importing an arbitrary host file still refuses credential-store paths, and review risk still rates credential-named paths critical. The historical release-attestation sealer no longer refuses a reviewer report or metadata file for credential-shaped text: it still requires strict UTF-8, the digest and exact-key bindings and its other checks, and the attestation carries digests and validated fields, never report text. A real key you put in working content is ordinary task material: it reaches the selected model and stays in local run records. Runs written by earlier versions keep their masked copies; their `persisted_patch: redacted` patches still apply only from the private exact object (`patch_exact_bytes_unavailable` when it is missing), and the MCP read tools still project their `secretLike` disclosure, which is `null` for new runs.

  **Breaking:** `pr` delivery now needs the pinned open-source scanner Betterleaks 1.9.0 and checks what would leave the machine with it instead of Claudexor's own patterns; an npm-installed CLI bundles no scanner, so its `pr` refuses with `publication_scan_unavailable` until one is provided (below). Before any branch, index or ref changes, the exact outgoing commit, every earlier commit that a URL `git push origin` sends to (its push URL when one is set) does not already advertise, read with `git ls-remote` (a secret added and later deleted included, and a commit only the fetch URL or another remote holds still counts), what each merge in that range itself changed (Git's remerge view, Git 2.36 or newer: a conflict resolution or an "evil" merge, never content its parents already carried; an octopus merge has no such view and is scanned for what it adds over its first parent, which can re-flag content a non-first parent already published), the commit messages of that range, the branch name and the PR title and body are scanned with live validation off; the PR body `gh` reads is the scanned copy, and the push sends exactly the scanned commit object. A finding refuses typed (`publication_scan_findings`, rule and place only, never the matched text; a file name or label the scanner itself flags is shown as `withheld location (sha256 …)`, and every place is withheld when that check cannot run); a missing or unpinned scanner (`publication_scan_unavailable`) and a scan that fails, times out, writes no valid report or reads a Git history that Git's own trace2 record does not prove complete (every `git log` it ran exited 0 without a signal; a `git log` killed mid-stream otherwise looks clean) (`publication_scan_failed`) also refuse, and local apply, branch and commit stay available. The outgoing repository's own `.gitleaksignore`/`.betterleaksignore`, inline allow comments and scanner environment variables cannot suppress a finding. The macOS app and its update closure now bundle the darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64 builds and each SSH runtime archive bundles its own target's build, with the MIT license and provenance (the SBOMs list them). npm installs, and hosts on other platforms embedding the closure, bundle none for their platform: point `CLAUDEXOR_BETTERLEAKS_PATH` at the pinned build or provision it with `node scripts/provision-betterleaks.mjs`. Delivery never downloads it. Betterleaks skips some binary, archive and lockfile content by design, so a clean scan is not proof that nothing sensitive is present. Repository CI and release use the same adapter in place of the old `git grep` step, over the range's commits, merges and messages and the tracked tree; a release being published also scans its annotated tag's message.

## 4.7.0

### Patch Changes

- 74fb275: Add `execution.auxiliaryWritableRoots`: exact caller-created service directories (a shared download cache, outside-Git scratch) an Agent run with effective `workspace_write` may also write. Admission records the canonical list in `TaskContract.access.auxiliary_writable_roots` and refuses unsafe, missing or conflicting grants with typed codes, including any overlap with the execution or source tree. Lanes negotiate it through `capability_profile.access_control.auxiliary_writable_roots` and the catalog's `accessControl.auxiliaryWritableRoots`: Codex applies it per turn through its native sandbox policy; a new turn with no roots drops the earlier grant, while `continueFrom` with no execution group inherits the predecessor's whole group. Other adapters refuse an explicit pool and drop from Auto. The CLI gains repeatable `--auxiliary-writable-root`; MCP run tools, `claudexor_thread_turn` and ACP carry the same member.

## 3.21.0

### Patch Changes

- f0ab916: Make one effort word work on every route. The vendor's own order still ranks every level it lists; the shared preference order (`none < minimal < low < medium < high < xhigh < max < ultra`) now places a word a route's ladder does not list, so `ultra` on a Claude binary that stops at `max` resolves downward to `max` and `none`/`minimal` resolve to the known minimum instead of refusing the run. The receipt names that placement and claims neither vendor support nor equal quality across vendors. One resolution result feeds the native flag, the typed receipt and the disclosure on Claude, Codex (sessions and raw model calls) and the ACP client, which now resolves `--effort` through the same resolver and records a receipt. A reviewer whose harness declares no effort controls keeps the preference as omitted with disclosure instead of failing the explicit panel or erasing the automatic panel's request. A word neither order knows is still refused before generation on routes that have a native effort knob.

## 3.20.0

### Minor Changes

- c12828c: Add a generic ACP v1 client harness with GitHub Copilot CLI as its first vendor.
  Use managed tokens and scoped homes, bounded typed streams, process-tree
  cancellation, a free session doctor and explicit paid write conformance.
  Model inventory is advisory; missing cost remains unknown. Copilot ACP is in
  preview: workspace writes are unfenced when permission callbacks are absent.
  Live input, native login and MCP injection are not included in this stage.

  Port permission, environment, launch, translation and lifecycle semantics from
  Róger Valderrama (@germago119), razzant/ouroboros#769, with the Q00 MIT notice
  retained in the new package.
