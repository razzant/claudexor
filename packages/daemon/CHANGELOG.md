### Minor Changes

- d9e7977: `claudexor project remove <project-id> --purge-trashed-threads` (`DELETE /v2/projects/:id?trashedThreads=purge`) removes a project together with the threads already in its trash, in one action (#333). Without the option, removal is unchanged and still refuses while any non-purged thread remains. The option purges only threads that are in the trash: an active or closed thread must be trashed first. The whole removal is refused, with nothing changed, while any thread is outside the trash (`project_has_threads`) or while any of the project's work is queued or running, including a thread Apply or a run started under a former root (`project_has_active_run`). The purges and the project's retirement are one store transaction. Each purged thread then loses what a thread purge deletes: its isolated worktree and `claudexor/thread-*` branch with any changes never applied, and its lane homes. The project folder, a delegated thread's caller-owned workspace and run artifacts are never deleted; the conversation rows stay in the engine store, while the threads leave every listing and can no longer be restored or resumed. The receipt's new `purgedThreads` lists each purged thread with `cleanup: "completed"`, or `"pending"` with the error; a pending cleanup is retried when the daemon next starts. A repeated or inexact `trashedThreads` value is refused with 400 before anything changes. Other query parameters stay ignored as before, so a misspelled parameter name gets the default removal, which still refuses while any non-purged thread remains.

  Every thread purge (Delete Now, expired trash, the retention retry, daemon startup and this removal) now reports a cleanup as completed only once the thread's worktree with its Git registration and branch and its lane homes are gone. When Git refuses, for example for a worktree locked with `git worktree lock` or a ref lock held by another Git process, the cleanup stays pending with Git's error, nothing Git still records is deleted, and a later attempt finishes it once the cause is gone. Git is asked in the repository that registered the worktree, which the worktree's own `.git` file names; a branch, registration or directory already gone there counts as removed. Without that file, the project folder's repository is asked. Because Git deletes the file with the worktree and a project folder can be replaced, the cleanup records the repository it asks before Git's first change there, so a later attempt or the next daemon start finishes in that same repository, and syncs its Git directories to disk, also when the project folder is gone or another repository is at the project path by then. Git drops a worktree's registration even when it fails to delete the worktree directory, for example a read-only one; the cleanup stays pending with Git's error, and once the directory can be deleted, a later attempt finishes it in that recorded repository. A repository moved without relinking the project, or deleted (the two look the same), keeps the cleanup pending too; after a move, `git worktree repair` in the moved repository lets the next daemon start finish it, and a recorded repository that moves away or is replaced at its path afterwards keeps it pending until it is back. Thread purge, the account lane cleanup and the orphan-lane sweep no longer follow a link inside Claudexor's runtime directory: a link above what they delete is refused with an error and its target is left untouched, and a link in place of what they delete is only unlinked. Before, such a link made the deletion follow it into the linked folder, and a Git refusal was reported as completed and never retried.

### Patch Changes

- 8bae6ae: Credential-shaped text in your own work is no longer refused or masked (#555, INV-146 retires INV-062). A review brief, prompt, instruction, output schema, test command, live or deferred message, interaction answer or attachment that contains a bearer header, an `sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA` key, a JWT or a PEM block now reaches the selected harness exactly; the typed `inline_secret_rejected` error is gone from the CLI, `POST /v2/runs`, thread turns, MCP and ACP. The task contract, command journal, served job params, thread history, events, SSE frames, answers, plans, reports, retained output, saved `patch.diff` copies, reviewer packets, reviewer workspaces, context packs and served artifacts keep the exact bytes, so Exact Retry, Run Again, continuation and later turns read back what was sent, and reviewers judge the same patch apply uses. Files named `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/…`, `.ssh/…` or `.claude/…` inside the project are ordinary project files for context, review, directory results, uploads and served outputs; Codex approval requests for them are offered instead of declined, and `review --diff` no longer refuses a diff. Claude `AskUserQuestion` text is shown exactly and answered by its native question text. Tool calls keep unmasked targets (command, path, query, URL) within each adapter's existing bounds, and tool results keep unmasked summaries of their output (`content_summary`, and a failed tool's own `error_summary`, within each adapter's existing bound and whitespace normalization) for every adapter, a Cursor shell command whose end is unconfirmed keeps its complete native result (`native_result`) exactly, a failed raw-API completion keeps the model's bounded partial output (`partial_output`) exact in its error event while it stays a failure, never becomes the answer and the provider's error report stays masked, a Copilot ACP answer keeps credential-shaped text exact (only the managed token Claudexor injected is removed), a work report's required inputs stay exact in telemetry and run facts, a planner's own `plans/<harness>.md` copy is its exact text, and the gate argv disclosed to a candidate is the argv the gate runner executes. Images are no longer withheld from `produced/` or from served outputs for their bytes; an image Claudexor did not save (over the per-image or total size cap, unreadable, a link, not a regular file or an unsafe path) is listed in the attempt's `produced_omitted` with its size and reason, and the run summary names it. Credentials Claudexor itself owns stay in their stores, outside every worktree, behind daemon authentication, grants, read-only and trust policy, root and symlink containment and digest checks; engine diagnostics (errors, stderr tails, probe output, vendor failure reports, also inside the run, attempt and reviewer event journals, which all pass through one masking step) are still masked. Claudexor never places its engine credentials into prompts, events or artifacts; a harness process can read the credential the engine hands it, and whatever the harness prints is ordinary output kept exactly in local run records, as in the vendor's own transcript. Importing an arbitrary host file still refuses credential-store paths, and review risk still rates credential-named paths critical. The historical release-attestation sealer no longer refuses a reviewer report or metadata file for credential-shaped text: it still requires strict UTF-8, the digest and exact-key bindings and its other checks, and the attestation carries digests and validated fields, never report text. A real key you put in working content is ordinary task material: it reaches the selected model and stays in local run records. Runs written by earlier versions keep their masked copies; their `persisted_patch: redacted` patches still apply only from the private exact object (`patch_exact_bytes_unavailable` when it is missing), and the MCP read tools still project their `secretLike` disclosure, which is `null` for new runs.

  **Breaking:** `pr` delivery now needs the pinned open-source scanner Betterleaks 1.9.0 and checks what would leave the machine with it instead of Claudexor's own patterns; an npm-installed CLI bundles no scanner, so its `pr` refuses with `publication_scan_unavailable` until one is provided (below). Before any branch, index or ref changes, the exact outgoing commit, every earlier commit that a URL `git push origin` sends to (its push URL when one is set) does not already advertise, read with `git ls-remote` (a secret added and later deleted included, and a commit only the fetch URL or another remote holds still counts), what each merge in that range itself changed (Git's remerge view, Git 2.36 or newer: a conflict resolution or an "evil" merge, never content its parents already carried; an octopus merge has no such view and is scanned for what it adds over its first parent, which can re-flag content a non-first parent already published), the commit messages of that range, the branch name and the PR title and body are scanned with live validation off; the PR body `gh` reads is the scanned copy, and the push sends exactly the scanned commit object. A finding refuses typed (`publication_scan_findings`, rule and place only, never the matched text; a file name or label the scanner itself flags is shown as `withheld location (sha256 …)`, and every place is withheld when that check cannot run); a missing or unpinned scanner (`publication_scan_unavailable`) and a scan that fails, times out, writes no valid report or reads a Git history that Git's own trace2 record does not prove complete (every `git log` it ran exited 0 without a signal; a `git log` killed mid-stream otherwise looks clean) (`publication_scan_failed`) also refuse, and local apply, branch and commit stay available. The outgoing repository's own `.gitleaksignore`/`.betterleaksignore`, inline allow comments and scanner environment variables cannot suppress a finding. The macOS app and its update closure now bundle the darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64 builds and each SSH runtime archive bundles its own target's build, with the MIT license and provenance (the SBOMs list them). npm installs, and hosts on other platforms embedding the closure, bundle none for their platform: point `CLAUDEXOR_BETTERLEAKS_PATH` at the pinned build or provision it with `node scripts/provision-betterleaks.mjs`. Delivery never downloads it. Betterleaks skips some binary, archive and lockfile content by design, so a clean scan is not proof that nothing sensitive is present. Repository CI and release use the same adapter in place of the old `git grep` step, over the range's commits, merges and messages and the tracked tree; a release being published also scans its annotated tag's message.

- 9a5ef43: `GET /v2/global/events` and `GET /v2/projects/:id/events` now replay and tail the retained journal in bounded pages (at most 256 events and 1 MiB of stored payload each) instead of reading, validating and writing the whole retained history before the first event. Replay stays complete and ordered with the same cursors and the same 409 `resnapshot` refusals; an event larger than a page is sent whole on its own. The daemon waits for a slow reader to drain before writing more, keeps one page read in flight per connection, and stops reading when the client leaves or the daemon stops. A stream whose partition generation is replaced now closes instead of continuing in the new epoch, including a stream that had not received an event yet. Motivation: issue #312, where back-to-back full snapshots of a dense root raised daemon RSS to 4.1 GB.
- f428c0a: Account resources can now show an OpenRouter key's own spending limit, for the key requests actually use, including the default one (#138). The engine reads OpenRouter's `GET /api/v1/key` (no generation, no account balance) for the default key and each enabled registered OpenRouter API-key account, on an explicit full or exact refresh only. Clients that send `includeApiKeys=true` with a resources view of `GET`/`POST /v2/quota` or the Accounts snapshot receive one row per key: the default key as `target.profile_id: null` (the API-key route, not an account) and each registered key, all bound to a non-secret `credential_fingerprint`. A replaced key never shows the previous key's figures and a removed key has no row. The spending row keeps the provider's decimal `limit` and `remaining`, `capped: false` for a key without a per-key limit (never zero or unlimited money), spend for its UTC `window`, and a reset instant only when OpenRouter reports one. Failed reads keep the last figures as stale with the cause. These rows never affect routing, quota admission or polling; clients that do not ask keep the previous response. `claudexor quota --resources` and the MCP `claudexor_account_resources` tool include them, and the macOS OpenRouter Auth sheet shows them in a Key allowance panel with a Refresh that reads only those keys.
- 2d83b87: Claude quota families now reach newly released models of that family (#394). A weekly Opus limit, whether read from the usage endpoint, reported during a run or carried by a typed Opus rejection, applies to every `claude-opus-…` id, including ones newer than the built-in model list, and no longer applies to `best`, a run that names no model, or another family. A weekly limit the vendor does not name, and an Antigravity quota group the adapter does not recognize, no longer block the whole account: each such window's id, usage and reset are written to the daemon's `quota.observation` log instead, even when the reading held no other window, while known family and account-wide limits keep blocking. A reading that held only such windows counts as a failed refresh, never as an account with no limits. Quota records written by earlier versions are read back in the new form, so an old Opus limit stops refusing `best` and is replaced by the next reading of the same window; an old reading that held only such unknown windows is read back as unknown, so it is not shown as current and the account is still polled. Other accounts, routes and windows are untouched.

  A short quota window that has reset no longer counts against an account, and no longer hides a weekly limit read at the same time (#457). Run admission judges each window separately at the moment it decides: within the five minutes a reading stays current, a weekly reserve still applies after the five-hour window resets. A reading never becomes fresher than when it was taken, and a reset window is not treated as new free quota. The next-account hint (both the ordinary Accounts read and an explicit refresh) and model operations make the same per-window decision as runs, so the hint never names an account a run would refuse. The quota display and the Accounts cards keep their existing whole-reading freshness.

  A pinned account refused by quota now says why (#318). The refusal keeps the `subscription_window_exhausted` code and adds `quotaRefusal.basis` to the run's failure record, `refusal_basis` to the problem context and `basis` to the `route.profile.headroom_exceeded` event: `owner_reserve` when usage reached your saved `headroom_threshold` while the provider still reports quota left, `provider_window` when the provider reports the window spent, and `provider_cooldown` for a provider rate-limit cooldown or a limit hit by the pinned run itself, in Agent, Ask, `--attempts` and Plan runs. A pinned Plan stopped by a provider limit now ends with the same typed code, reset time and basis instead of a generic harness error; a limit the vendor recovered from, or a Plan that ended for another reason (context exhaustion, an empty plan, an invalid work report, an outdated Claude Code CLI, a Claude API error other than HTTP 429 such as a rejected login, a crash or cancellation), keeps its own cause. A provider limit is never labelled as your reserve, whatever the threshold, including a spent window whose reset time is unknown. The window, usage and reset time reported with a refusal all come from the limit that decided it, and a run whose candidates hit different windows reports only what they share. The saved reserve still applies to a pinned account and a pin still never moves to another account; the default threshold stays 100%. When every account stopped only at its saved reserve, the next-account hint says so. Authentication and billing failures are not quota refusals and are not covered by this change.

### Patch Changes

- 67b8833: Release old unreferenced artifacts and native sessions after archived project bindings are cleared. Reclaim aged, unnamed revert/exact-patch objects and empty engine containers while preserving surviving runs and recovery holds. Expose a durable last cleanup outcome, counted holds and errors through `claudexor gc --last` and `GET /v2/maintenance/gc`.

  Preserve complete NUL-delimited interaction IDs on Node 24.15 when pruning commands and observing retention changes, so question event groups and bodies are released and questions published during cleanup protect their runs.

  Preserve live workspace, Git checkout and harness-home directories during cleanup. Keep hold history through interrupted inventory, recover unreadable last-pass records with a passive diagnostic, and report unsupported native adapters without false holds.

  Keep foreign Codex session entries informational and preserve unobserved holds through interrupted cleanup. Reclaim empty run-retirement containers and avoid removal attempts on nonempty containers.

- f88a561: Fix multi-run waits and task-group recovery (#513, #514, #515).

  A daemon that stops while `POST /v2/runs/wait-many` (`claudexor_runs_wait`, CLI `runs-wait`) is waiting now answers a retryable `503 daemon_stopping` at once instead of holding the shutdown until a forced exit; a launch whose run has not started yet gets its `202` receipt. `waitMs` bounds the wait between reads, never a read: a read under way at the deadline finishes and its facts and attention are the answer, so a short positive `waitMs` no longer returns every target `not_observed`. A problem row's `null` token can be echoed as `seen: null` to acknowledge that problem, so the wait continues for the healthy targets instead of returning at once; output shapes are unchanged. Observation tokens never match the secret scan that guards MCP input. A request body the daemon refuses keeps its connection until the typed `413` is read, on JSON routes and upload bytes alike, and stop closes only connections still sending such a body.

  Waits wake from the store's post-commit notices for the watched jobs, runs and questions instead of a 250 ms poll that re-read every target, and they re-read only the targets a notice names. Group pages add each member once instead of re-serializing the page per member.

  Task-group membership now ignores the letter case of the group UUID: engine schema 6 stores the canonical lower-case group in a `command.task_group_id` column, backfilled for live and archived rows, and answers keep the caller's spelling. Older engines refuse the upgraded store, and group cursors issued before the upgrade restart with `stale_cursor`. A tagged launch, retry or decision rerun is refused before acceptance when the store identity is unavailable; a decision rerun keeps its group and answers `newJobId` with the group receipt. A CLI wait that fails after acceptance keeps the job receipt in the error context. CLI `--wait-ms` and `--limit` accept only plain decimal integers.

  Changes that controllers and embedders can see: earlier CLI and MCP clients check `seen` locally and refuse `null`, and an earlier daemon refuses a request that carries it, so acknowledging a problem needs both sides upgraded. A token saved from an earlier engine that the MCP secret scan refuses can be dropped from `seen` once to receive its re-derived replacement. A target hidden by pruning, archive or a generation change during a wait shows `not_found` at the deadline's read rather than at once. `GET /v2/task-groups/:id/runs` refuses a `limit` with a leading zero. The CLI's bounded observation reads report a malformed daemon answer as non-retryable `invalid_service_response` and a read timeout as `run_observation_timeout`. Embedders of `DaemonControlApiServer` can pass the new optional `runObservationChanges` feed; without it waits keep the 250 ms poll, and wait-many no longer subscribes to the `bus` option, which still drives the event streams.

## 4.8.0

### Patch Changes

- Add operator-only editable next messages for daemon-owned one-shot Agent and Ask runs: `claudexor_next_message` and `claudexor_next_message_read`, CLI `next-message` and `next-message-read`, and HTTP `/v2/runs/next-message`. One revisioned draft reserves the predecessor's single successor claim. An eligible settled success sends it once as an ordinary continuation through the existing admission and queue; failure, unknown process custody, Stop, restart or admission refusal holds it without retry. Controls and Settings execution preferences are captured at creation and shown by origin on the bounded read, while permissions, trust, accounts and quota stay current at dispatch.

  Public Stop (`POST /v2/runs/:id/control`, `claudexor_run_cancel`) holds a waiting draft whatever the predecessor's lifecycle and reports an already accepted successor as `next_message_dispatched` without cancelling it. If the hold cannot be saved, the run is still stopped, the draft is not sent, and Stop answers 503 `next_message_hold_failed`. `claudexor_run_cancel` failures now keep the control API's typed problem: their text starts with the code (for example `http_409: run is succeeded; cancel has nothing to stop`), and the structured failure carries the code, required actions and context.

  The orchestrator exports `captureRunDefaults`, `executionRunConfig` and `resolveRunInputDefaults`, accepts captured `executionDefaults`, and adds `preflightOneShot` for dispatch validation without starting a run.

  Engine-store schema 4 adds the `deferred_message` table in an atomic forward-only migration; older engines refuse an upgraded store.

- 7dfbc42: Add document ingress over the existing upload owner. MCP gains the upload stage tools (`claudexor_upload_create`, `claudexor_upload_import_local`, `claudexor_upload_status`, `claudexor_upload_finalize`, `claudexor_upload_cancel`) with matching CLI verbs, and public runs, thread turns and continuations accept strict `attachments: [{resourceId}]` refs. Codex carries verified references for TXT, Markdown, JSON, PDF and DOCX; this is byte access with no parsing or OCR promise.

  A keyed import binds one source to one immutable resource under a saved store id and caller key: `claudexor_store_identity` and `claudexor_upload_import`, CLI `store-identity` and `upload-import`, and HTTP `POST /v2/uploads/imports`. A completed import replays its original resource before the client reads the source, even after the source changed or was deleted. Other arguments or other bytes under the same key are refused without effects, another store is refused before any effect, and verified bytes received before a lost reply or a daemon restart are published on replay. An import's interrupted or unverified transfer returns to `open` so the same key can resend it; ordinary uploads keep their single-shot cancellation. CLI runs take ready refs with `--attach-resource`.

  Existing callers see three behavior changes. CLI `--attach` now labels `.pdf` and `.docx` files `application/pdf` and `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` (previously `application/octet-stream`), so lane admission matches those types. Codex now declares TXT, Markdown and JSON as well as PDF and DOCX file inputs, so Auto routing keeps Codex for runs that carry them where it used to drop it, and explicit pools that include Codex now admit them; Auto and pool choices for such runs can change. The Delegate belt's run tools accept `attachments: [{resourceId}]` refs, while the belt still exposes no upload controls.

- Add bounded thread history reads. `GET /v2/threads/:id/history` returns one page of at most 20 turns with prompt and answer previews and receipt facts, chosen by a cursor or a before, after or around turn id, and `GET /v2/threads/:id/turns/:turnId/prompt` returns a bounded UTF-8 part of a turn's complete stored prompt, refused turns included, with its total size and SHA-256. CLI `thread history` and `thread prompt` and MCP `claudexor_thread_history` and `claudexor_thread_prompt` expose the same reads; they require an existing daemon and never start one. The existing thread detail read remains available.

  A page stays within 2 MiB of JSON. A stale cursor fails as `thread_history_cursor_stale` with the `resnapshot` required action, and a turn whose run record was pruned reads as `not_retained` instead of failing the page.

  Engine-store schema 5 adds only the `turn_plan_answer` index in an atomic forward-only migration; building it scans existing turns once without rewriting them, and older engines refuse an upgraded store.

## 4.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 30f8195: Preserve optional caller-generated task group membership in accepted one-shot jobs and their receipts. Tagged receipts identify the accepting store, Exact Retry retains membership, and new continuations join a group only when explicitly requested. Add atomic engine-store schema version 3 expression indexes for retained group membership.

  Recover original queued and bound job handles with the bounded `task-group-runs` CLI, `claudexor_task_group_runs` MCP tool and HTTP group page. Store/view/filter-bound cursors require explicit paging; compact member observations share the multi-run attention contract. Results cover retained rows in currently served generations, not a permanent roster. Discovery adds no launch, retry, resume, answer, permissions or budget authority.

  Document durable caller receipts, exact keyed replay, separate interaction/result reads and storage downgrade precautions. Add deterministic built CLI/MCP/HTTP qualification stories for controller loss, queued binding, replay conflicts, store mismatch, archive visibility and daemon-crash interruption without autoresume. Manual host UI and real-vendor qualification remain separate.

## 4.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 032b44b: Demote Codex accounts for a model after a pre-generation refusal. A recognized capability refusal (`model_capability_refused`) marks the account at once; any other definite provider HTTP 4xx before generation on an auto operation (outside sign-in, timeouts, conflicts, rate and quota limits, the processing fallback, server failures and typed request faults) offers the same single correlated host retry, which becomes a confirmed mark when another account serves and marks nothing when it refuses too. Both kinds also record the shared pre-progress refusal observation, so Agent runs of that model order the account last as well, and an older in-flight refusal never undoes a newer model operation's service. Auto selection prefers accounts whose live catalog lists the model, then advisory misses, then accounts with only a soft observation (a recent refusal, or a served-model substitution of a non-preferred account), then capability-marked accounts; history bound to an unmarked, unrefused preferred account stays on that account. Refusal problems carry `modelMarks` (each live mark with the start of its episode) and `alternativeRemains` (whether another selectable account without a mark remains). Routing receipts (`captureRoutingEvidence=true` on `POST /v2/model-operations`) and capability rows (`includeCapabilities=true` on `GET /v2/accounts/routing-evidence`) are opt-in over HTTP, so strict 4.4.0 clients keep their shapes; Claudexor's own CLI and MCP readers request the rows. Behavior change: the recognized Codex refusals (an explicit `model_not_found` or `model_not_supported` code, the ChatGPT-account unsupported-model sentence, the narrow missing-model sentences) now return `model_capability_refused` instead of `invalid_request` or `model_unavailable` (an explicit vendor `model_not_found` still records the model-scoped unusable verdict), and `preferredProfileId` no longer wins over a listed account or over its own mark or recent refusal; history bound to that account keeps it first over a catalog miss only while it has neither.

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Daemon status reports per-route request latency (one count of completed responses or disconnects with p50, p99 and max for the lifetime and the last loop window, keyed by HTTP method and operation-catalog template) and the 32 longest labelled synchronous sections since start (store BEGIN and COMMIT, external writes, run detail and summary projections, scope persistence), plus lifetime COMMIT p50 and p99. A request whose client has already hung up skips its pending heavy read projections; an admitted mutation still completes. `POST /v2/handshake` returns the durable engine store id as `storeId` to a client that sends `X-Claudexor-Store-Identity: 1`, and every other client keeps the earlier response shape. `scripts/daemon-load-bench.mjs` compares an exact base against the working tree in alternating trials inside temporary roots it owns. Moving checkpoints off the request thread was measured and not adopted: it lowered COMMIT tails but not the event-loop tail consistently (`docs/benchmarks/daemon-sync-20261020.md`).
- Engine retention retires unregistered and archived project histories, orphaned run trees and unreferenced native session parts in recurring bounded maintenance and never removes anything still referenced; immutable attempt, final and anchor patches share one content-addressed object per project where hard links are supported (#477).
- After a SQL miss, an addressed legacy upload binding that cannot be read or parsed answers HTTP 503 `legacy_upload_binding_unavailable` instead of minting a new upload (while the legacy directory itself is unreadable, every SQL miss is refused, new keys included), and internal model results publish without a historical lookup. Thanks to @josephsteuerjr (#474).
- MCP controllers get idempotent one-shot launches and durable run supervision: `claudexor_run_wait`, `claudexor_run_message`, `claudexor_run_continue` and bounded `claudexor_run_event_read` parts. Thanks to @IlidanNaga (#478).

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Ordinary Codex Fast (`fast`/`priority`) on a verified ChatGPT subscription is included service under no-paid routing and every cash cap, including `finite(0)`; verified Codex subscription work now reports its cash as unknown (`spendUsd` and `budget_summary.spend_usd` null, cost basis `debit: "unobserved"`) beside the cap-governed `controllableSpendUsd` instead of exact zero, and without a preference keeps the first account's chosen speed across retries, Exact Retry, rotation and continuation (#468, thanks @IlidanNaga). Codex catalogs keep a declared `inputModalities` list only when it is wholly valid and non-empty, as metadata that gates no request (#435, thanks @josephsteuerjr). The opt-in `GET /v2/quota?view=resources_freshness` view adds a required `availability_scope` echo, Cursor accounts report dated display-only monetary resources from Cursor's internal dashboard through the existing refresh cycle, and Antigravity's native headless permission auto-denial becomes typed `permission_denial` evidence without retry or access elevation (#467).

  Codex workspace-write uses native on-request with auto_review by default and an explicit one-action retry handback; HTTP/MCP can revise the existing live soft/hard timer, and configuration can disable only inactivity timing with null (#466, thanks @IlidanNaga). This adds no session-wide grant, readonly bypass, automatic retry authorization by Claudexor, per-run idle field or installed CLI update; timers are not restored after daemon loss and native UI/vendor qualification remains limited.

- 23a74cb: Let any controlling MCP agent inspect and answer native worker approvals through
  the existing interaction tools. Codex workspace-write runs use native automatic
  review and can hand back one exact denied action for an explicitly authorized
  same-session retry, without changing managed policy or granting session-wide access.
  A request the worker withdraws itself emits `interaction.withdrawn`, closing the
  obsolete follow prompt or app card instead of blocking the next approval.

  A completed Codex turn's answer, including a structured WorkReport envelope,
  is kept before any handback; a denial that cannot be presented exactly is
  disclosed and stands natively instead of failing the run. A thread that settles
  in systemError never hands a denial back, authorizes it or starts another turn.

  The verified Codex pin moves from codex-cli 0.156.1 to 0.162.1. Its captured
  model snapshot makes `gpt-6.1-sol` the fallback default and a known model. An
  installed 0.156.1 no longer matches the snapshot provenance: without a live
  `model/list`, its effort snapshot is not trusted (no effort flag is sent) and
  no turn-input bound is published for it.

  Add revision-guarded live run time-limit read, set, extend and disable controls,
  soft warnings and optional inactivity-watchdog disabling. Existing explicit
  maxSeconds limits remain hard by default; omitting a limit adds no deadline, and
  `set` keeps the timer's current mode unless one is named. Inactivity windows
  longer than one Node timer delay are honored instead of firing immediately.

### Minor Changes

- Preserve successful-account routing evidence across restarts and retain complete settled refusal diagnostics. Address run and thread lists before materialization, and retain answers, monetary facts and source work when capture exceeds its bounded string budget. Engine-store schema 2 is forward-only; retain a full stopped pre-upgrade data-root backup for recovery with an older engine.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Generate and edit images through subscription-backed Codex accounts as a payload kind of the existing caller-owned model operations. Upload an `ImageCallRequest` with `purpose: "model"` and create it with `POST /v2/model-operations?requestKind=image` (omission stays text): the same idempotency key, queue, SQL flush barrier before the provider request, cancellation, private result with 30-day unacknowledged retention and whole-result digest ACK serve both kinds, with no second scheduler and no subscription-to-API fallback. A failed barrier or a cancellation before the request reports that nothing was sent. `ImageCallResult` keeps the requested model apart from the provider-observed route model, the applied options, reported usage, unknown cash and every usable image with its verified MIME, size and digest; rejected siblings are named in the problem context instead of discarding the good ones. `GET /v2/model-sources?view=accounts` declares the source's structural `imageGeneration` facet, whose model ids are presence hints, not an entitlement. Quota constraints may declare `applies_to_request_kinds` (absent applies to both kinds): Codex `codex`/`default` windows are text and `image_gen` is image, an image 429 with an observed reset enters the registry as image-only evidence, and `GET /v2/quota` (including its resources and constraint-freshness views) and `POST /v2/quota` accept optional `requestKind` and `model`. Image windows stay visible in Accounts, labelled, but no longer drive text availability, the compact text percentage, the cooldown badge or a run's quota-pressure disclosure; legacy unscoped windows keep applying to both kinds until a newer measured scoped read replaces them. Unrecognised Codex full-read and rollout buckets are no longer recorded as quota constraints; notification payloads retain diagnostic evidence without guessed applicability. Request-kind availability selection is HTTP-only; CLI/MCP remain text-default. Live proof covers one generation and one edit through the real adapter on one managed account before the SQL store; SQL custody is covered by real-store tests over a synthetic endpoint, and other accounts' entitlement, image quota headers and the released live chain remain unverified. Thanks to @josephsteuerjr for the original image-operations contribution (#428).

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- Move engine state to one SQLite store with addressed reads, resumable legacy import, generation-scoped recovery and explicit durability barriers. Require Node 24.15 or newer. Remove the implicit shared admission ceiling, preserve explicit global caps, and allow separate model and long-session caps in the existing queue. Preserve managed host bindings across plugin repair. Engine 4.0 requires desktop application 4.0; the updater keeps an older working engine until the app is updated. Legacy journals, run artifacts and accounts remain intact; the migrated format supports forward recovery, not downgrade to 3.x.

### Minor Changes

- 2fbf7c9: Keep the daemon responsive under load without changing any on-disk format. The control API, model operations and harness maintenance reach the daemon's dispatcher in process (`DaemonLocalClient`), so a slow event loop no longer turns their calls into ten-second `daemon_busy` failures; problem fields are unchanged and socket clients keep their transport bound. `ControlDaemonStatus.loop` reports the last ten-second event-loop window (delay p50/p99/max, busy share, GC pauses) as facts, and `claudexor daemon status` prints it. `POST /v2/projects` answers `created`, which `claudexor project register` prints. Run detail reads `lastSeq` from the live writer or the log tail, the project list computes nesting in one pass, `appendLine` takes Node's UTF-8 write without a mkdir per line, Codex rate limits are read incrementally, pid snapshots are written asynchronously on change only, per-request config reads reuse the parse until a source changes, and the control API sets explicit HTTP keep-alive, header and request timeouts.

## 3.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 902532e: Select retained commands by an explicit address before compact collection projection, preserving exact retry, HTTP run pages, continuation admission and uncapped cancellation. Remove the control API's whole-history self-RPC and make project activity checks synchronous with removal.

  Report daemon transport failures as retryable 503 problems while preserving typed refusal context and required actions; a thread turn whose enqueue answer was lost stays retryable and its retry reads the journal instead of enqueueing a duplicate. Untyped enqueue failures on POST /v2/runs now carry code internal_error instead of http_500. Refuse an admitted continuation whose source vanished before starting any harness work.

  Expose current and admission memory through authenticated GET /v2/daemon/status without changing the handshake. Publish engine heap launch arguments in the additive probe contract and apply them in the CLI and the macOS app launcher, honoring explicit NODE_OPTIONS. Resident journal-history growth and archive continuation remain outside this patch.

## 3.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 51578d4: Continue a stopped run instead of restarting it: `POST /v2/runs {continueFrom: <runId>, continueCarrier?: "auto" | "packet"}` starts the next run of a continuation chain. Admission is one daemon-atomic rule shared by every ingress (`predecessor_unknown`, `predecessor_live`, `continue_from_with_thread`, `continue_from_unsupported`, `continuation_superseded` with the chain `head`): the accepted successor command is the durable claim, so a predecessor has exactly one accepted successor, also across restarts and concurrent requests. Omitted mode, scope, execution, harness and model come from the predecessor, and the prompt is the caller's continuation text (it may be empty). The successor's first try is planned through the in-run continuation planner from the predecessor's session capsule and terminal facts — the same account resumes the vendor session by id, another account resumes the moved session, otherwise a fresh session is briefed with the evidence index — and is disclosed by a `run.continuity` receipt naming the predecessor and whether it runs in the same root. A stopped isolated Agent run now keeps its envelope (tree and scoped home, Claudexor-seeded auth removed) under a durable custody record until a successor adopts it, its result is applied or it is discarded; the crash sweep and disk retention keep it, and a run interrupted by a daemon restart with changes is kept the same way. `GET /v2/runs/:id` projects `resumable` (derived as `host_restart` for runs the daemon found running at its restart), the per-try `continuity` receipts, `retainedEnvelope` (disk use) and `continueFrom`; `continueFrom` is advertised in `runControlKeys`.

### Patch Changes

- a4ff572: Reconcile older quota refusals with newer account observations, preserve genuine credential rejections without duplicating poller state, and pace quota reads per affected account. Ordinary Accounts and account-catalog reads retain their first observation instead of repeatedly probing vendors. Discover Antigravity models for the selected account, forward explicitly requested unlisted models with disclosure, and preserve known quota-family applicability for new model IDs.

### Patch Changes

- 72825b9: Resolve effort preferences at the final native route using the strongest supported level at or below a known request, with an explicitly recorded minimum or vendor-default omission when applicable. Preserve advertised future values, original preferences and model identities. Add shared typed effort evidence to model results and final attempt telemetry; keep adaptation disclosures in logs.

  Preserve strict legacy model results unless creation opts into `captureEffortEvidence=true`, binding that choice to idempotency while keeping exact stored bytes and digest acknowledgement. Keep effort verification metadata in negotiated account catalogs only. Refuse unplaceable effort without retrying another route, clean temporary Codex authorization on preparation exit, and describe prepared controls without claiming dispatch.

## 3.12.1

### Patch Changes

- Reading ONE run no longer serializes every retained run. The daemon's retained-command list RPC takes an optional query addressing a single subject (one run id, or one parent's direct Delegate children) and selects before it redacts, so `GET /v2/runs/:id` stops recursively projecting the prompts of unrelated runs; the unqualified read and the global `GET /v2/runs` page are unchanged, and an engine older than the query answers in full so callers keep applying their own selection.

## 3.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 217d53f: The daemon stops writing dead history into its journal and forgets it on replay. Per-token harness deltas no longer reach the journal (the per-run event log and the live stream keep them), the journaled `run.created` carries the prompt's digest instead of its text, `command.updated` frames omit the immutable params, quota snapshots are journaled only when their evidence changes and the projection marker carries a digest, and the retained params of terminal commands are capped by a code constant. Every partition replays and compacts through the daemon's fold policy, so startup memory follows the retained state rather than the file (a resolved question and its request are forgotten together, so answering an already-resolved question after a restart reports `not_found` rather than `already_resolved` — both non-delivery statuses; within one process life `already_resolved` is unchanged); crash-GC reads project roots from the already prepared command projection instead of replaying the journal a second time, journaled run events are validated once per generation, and journal maintenance re-requests itself when the file crosses the threshold again while logging typed declines and `journal.records_retired` receipts. An engine from before this change refuses a served root loudly. A restart on an already-compacted partition no longer rewrites it to reclaim nothing, and the daemon reports its own memory (rss, heap, external) on the normal-admission line and on every maintenance receipt. Legacy `command.pruned` tombstones carry no run ids, so terminals of runs pruned before this release stay retained (none on the acceptance root); runs that never received a journaled terminal keep their pre-release progress frames until their command is pruned (then the tombstone's run_ids retire them — bounded by the 500 / 30-day / 256 MiB rule); two such runs hold about 3.1k `harness.event` frames on the acceptance root.

## 3.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add caller-owned Codex model operations through managed accounts shared with Agents, with exact model payloads, durable single-generation identity, result acknowledgement and typed outcome/cost evidence. Keep system prompts, conversation history and tool execution with the caller. Preserve unconfirmed setup termination during runtime replacement; a pre-permit failure without recorded process evidence remains unreconcilable and is disclosed rather than introducing a new journal format. Simplify contributor release review while retaining signed runtime manifests and exact candidate promotion.

### Patch Changes

- dd518f0: Reduce journal startup work by selecting projection record types before copying payloads and validating run-event projections once during creation. Stop compression at the existing frame output limit while preserving full history, recovery checks, and compaction maintenance.

## 3.9.6

### Patch Changes

- 7e1269c: Background quota polling no longer lets one revoked, never-logged-in, or failing profile pin its vendor's healthy profiles to the 15-minute retry ceiling: a lane whose fresh evidence is about to expire renews on schedule even mid-ladder. The Claude OAuth source also remembers a proven vendor rejection per presented token and stops re-presenting it on background cycles — until the token changes, a login or profile change, an explicit refresh, or six hours, after which one remembered token is re-verified per cycle — so a rejected token reaches the vendor at most once per six hours instead of every cycle, removing the 401 storm behind the one-hour vendor 429 that blacked out every healthy sibling.

## 3.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 69500f8: Foreground quota refreshes (POST /v2/quota and the atomic Accounts snapshot) now honor each vendor's poll rate-limit cooldown: a vendor that recently answered 429 is served from last-known registry data instead of a fresh fan-out, disclosed additively as `refresh_skipped` rows on the quota response.
- e39c57b: Suppressed quota polls never fall silent: gap absences (rate_limited, probe_skipped_rate_limited, and the new derived poll_paced) coexist with stale snapshots and are silenced only by fresh ones, so downstream exhaustion readers stay fail-open while a vendor's poll pacing is cooling.
- 48ae659: Quota poll pacing is now per vendor lane: each vendor's refreshers own an independent completion-anchored backoff, a typed rate_limited absence arms a persisted vendor Retry-After floor in daemon-private pacer state (never the quota journal), and a daemon restart or credential change no longer resets the vendor cooldown into a 429 amplifier.

## 3.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 895967f: Unified account model (INV-135 rewrite, owner-approved). Every account is a
  named registry row — the separate "default"/"CLI login" account type is gone.
  A detected legacy claude/codex default-store login auto-registers at daemon
  start as the ordinary `<harness>-default` row through a crash-recoverable
  migration (typed per-harness run refusal while incomplete; rollback command
  as the supported downgrade path). Unpinned runs route through a quota-aware
  pool of enabled+ready rows with sticky, disclosed thread bindings; explicit
  pins are strict (typed `subscription_window_exhausted` refusal, no silent
  rotation); pool exhaustion is a typed `credential_pool_exhausted` terminal
  carrying the pool's earliest known reset, and the paid API-key route serves
  it only under the explicit `api_key` preference — never silently under
  `auto` (owner Q3=A). New wire: additive `accountPools` pool
  authority plus `GET /v2/account-pools` (the feature marker) and
  `POST /v2/accounts-migration/rollback`; `harnessAccounts` stays on the wire
  as `[]` for legacy strict clients. Cursor host-Keychain logins are retired:
  every cursor account lives in an isolated vendor file-store row, and
  `auth login` becomes bootstrap sugar into the `<harness>-default` row.
  Deleting a row is provable (typed retryable error on partial cleanup) and
  retires migrated legacy aliases in the same operation.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Claudexor 2.1.0: credential profiles (INV-135). Multiple subscriptions per
  harness with isolated vendor config dirs and namespaced secret slots; strict
  per-turn / thread-sticky selection with profile-isolated native-session
  resume; per-profile doctor probes and proactive per-profile subscription
  quota from the vendor oauth/usage endpoint; one typed profile policy per
  harness with provenance-recorded rotation on typed vendor-limit evidence
  only. Includes the unpublished 2.0.1 honest-engine and 2.0.2 simple-UI
  passes.

### Patch Changes

- 0fc050b: Credential profiles (INV-135): durable non-secret `credential_profiles`
  registry in the global config; the orchestrator resolves an explicit per-run
  profile id ONCE and stamps the typed profile on every HarnessRunSpec; adapters
  consume exactly the profile's transport (claude config-dir login / non-bare
  token / key; codex scoped CODEX_HOME / scoped auth.json; cursor, opencode,
  raw-api secret-ref keys) or refuse typed — never a fallback to default
  credentials. Namespaced secret slots (`claude_oauth:<profile>`), per-profile
  doctor probes (`GET /credential-profiles`, `claudexor profiles`), interactive
  `claudexor profiles login`, profile-stamped route evidence, and
  profile-isolated native-session resume.
