# @claudexor/schema

## 3.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Preserve useful contradictory Council drafts as explicitly unverified merger inputs and move journal maintenance after admission, including Windows pending-tail recovery and native coverage.
  - @claudexor/util@3.10.2

## 3.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Keep Antigravity model and quota checks non-interactive by closing piped input instead of using a null device. Preserve ambiguous authentication timeouts as probe failures and expose failed refreshes alongside stale quota data.
  - @claudexor/util@3.10.1

## 3.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add caller-owned Codex model operations through managed accounts shared with Agents, with exact model payloads, durable single-generation identity, result acknowledgement and typed outcome/cost evidence. Keep system prompts, conversation history and tool execution with the caller. Preserve unconfirmed setup termination during runtime replacement; a pre-permit failure without recorded process evidence remains unreconcilable and is disclosed rather than introducing a new journal format. Simplify contributor release review while retaining signed runtime manifests and exact candidate promotion.

### Patch Changes

- @claudexor/util@3.10.0

## 3.9.8

### Patch Changes

- Make internal model review opt-in for ordinary Agent work, independently of executor selection. Preserve explicit panels, Best-of, and requested review cycles; persist intent separately from results and retain historical behavior on replay. Deliberately unreviewed changes remain normally applicable with honest Not reviewed status while required checks and patch integrity remain enforced. Expose the same choice through API, CLI, MCP, ACP, and the native composer.

## 3.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Preserve typed text-fragment metadata in delegated run timelines so hosts can join streamed words and whitespace without inserting event separators. Keep complete messages, tool events, final answers, and omission disclosures distinct.

  Allow release review by any two distinct approved model families on any harness, recording the actual model and harness while retaining exact-candidate evidence, independent reports, and signed attestation checks.

## 3.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d9cccac: The cursor adapter can now host the delegation belt: engine-owned MCP servers are injected by reconciling `mcp.json` inside the Claudexor-owned lane `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` (sidecar-manifest reconcile; the host `~/.cursor` is never written; stale managed entries are removed on non-delegate runs) with `--approve-mcps`, and `capability_profile.mcp_injection` is declared true. The owner-set live delegated E2E recorded in docs/FEATURES.md has been executed (bounded probe: a real cursor-agent loaded the injected belt and it answered typed over MCP; the full parent-run hop remains follow-up evidence).
- 69500f8: Foreground quota refreshes (POST /v2/quota and the atomic Accounts snapshot) now honor each vendor's poll rate-limit cooldown: a vendor that recently answered 429 is served from last-known registry data instead of a fresh fan-out, disclosed additively as `refresh_skipped` rows on the quota response.
- e39c57b: Suppressed quota polls never fall silent: gap absences (rate_limited, probe_skipped_rate_limited, and the new derived poll_paced) coexist with stale snapshots and are silenced only by fresh ones, so downstream exhaustion readers stay fail-open while a vendor's poll pacing is cooling.
- fd623ff: Parse Retry-After on oauth/usage 429 into a typed `rate_limited` quota absence carrying `retry_after_ms`, so poll pacing can honor the vendor floor instead of recording an undiagnosed refresh failure.
- 278e436: The claude oauth-usage candidate loop short-circuits after the first 429 (unprobed siblings get the honest distinct `probe_skipped_rate_limited` absence, never a fabricated `rate_limited`), and the agy profile fan-out is bounded to 3 concurrent vendor probes; the same short-circuit seam is in place for agy and arms once its vendor classifier learns to type 429s (today the live agy win is the concurrency bound).

## 3.8.1

### Patch Changes

- ce6dba1: Prepare an isolated macOS keychain inside each Antigravity credential profile before vendor probes, quota reads, logins, and runs. The vendor's existing file fallback and profile separation remain unchanged.
- 2794ec7: Remove the engine-owned outer Seatbelt wrapper and restore each harness's
  native access policy. Delegated mutating runs now keep stable project identity
  separate from their disposable execution workspace, active requests use
  `readonly`, `workspace_write`, or explicitly trusted `full`, and historical
  outer-confinement artifacts remain readable without enabling new retired-mode
  runs.

### Patch Changes

- 6054b7d: Make credential-profile custody and managed setup login platform-aware, with an exact Windows Antigravity one-binding policy, vendor-proven doctor/quota results, durable ambiguity handling, and host-resolved terminal capability projection.

### Patch Changes

- @claudexor/util@3.7.0

## 3.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 895967f: Unified account model (INV-135 rewrite, owner-approved). Every account is a
  named registry row — the separate "default"/"CLI login" account type is gone.
  A detected legacy claude/codex default-store login auto-registers at daemon
  start as the ordinary `<harness>-default` row through a crash-recoverable
  migration (typed per-harness run refusal while incomplete; rollback command
  as the supported downgrade path). Unpinned runs route through a quota-aware
  pool of enabled+ready rows with sticky, disclosed thread bindings; explicit
  pins are strict (typed `subscription_window_exhausted` refusal, no silent
  rotation); pool exhaustion is a typed `credential_pool_exhausted` terminal
  carrying the pool's earliest known reset, and the paid API-key route serves
  it only under the explicit `api_key` preference — never silently under
  `auto` (owner Q3=A). New wire: additive `accountPools` pool
  authority plus `GET /v2/account-pools` (the feature marker) and
  `POST /v2/accounts-migration/rollback`; `harnessAccounts` stays on the wire
  as `[]` for legacy strict clients. Cursor host-Keychain logins are retired:
  every cursor account lives in an isolated vendor file-store row, and
  `auth login` becomes bootstrap sugar into the `<harness>-default` row.
  Deleting a row is provable (typed retryable error on partial cleanup) and
  retires migrated legacy aliases in the same operation.

### Patch Changes

- Carry optional model applicability on vendor quota constraints, live rate-limit signals, and budget observations.
- @claudexor/util@3.2.1

## 3.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Add shared contracts for nullable interaction waits, run applicability and Git capability, atomic credential snapshots, durable problems, and canonical run strategy and presentation truth.
- Remove the unproduced `WorkProduct.evidence_dir` placeholder; evidence paths remain owned by concrete run and review receipts.
- Add the optional sealed relative permit window used by deferred client-PTY
  setup runners after a deadline extension.
- Keep frozen plan references server-owned at the thread-turn boundary and carry
  the deciding credential profile in the run auth-route receipt.
- Reject transient device-code projections outside an active Codex login that
  is awaiting the user.
- @claudexor/util@3.2.0

## 3.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Restore Delegate in packaged installs through the exact daemon self-entry; enforce required MCP startup, bounded shared parent/child budget and cancellation authority, typed lineage and degradation receipts, and durable CLI/macOS projections across reload and reconnect.
  - @claudexor/util@3.1.2

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Effort ladders are per (harness, model) and follow the vendor-advertised order.
  Levels are discovered live from each CLI (with a snapshot fallback when a probe
  is unavailable), the full official vocabularies are supported, and a level the
  run cannot honor is disclosed instead of silently clamped. A profile-scoped run
  is no longer held to the default account's ladder, and hint-less runs resolve
  against the default model's own ladder.
  - @claudexor/util@3.1.1

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c3b7ece: Support declared JSON Schema draft-07 and draft 2020-12 output contracts, publish the supported dialect catalog, and record the selected dialect plus stable schema hash in structured-output receipts. Local JSON Pointer references are inlined only for native provider transport while the original schema remains the validation authority.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Claudexor 2.1.0: credential profiles (INV-135). Multiple subscriptions per
  harness with isolated vendor config dirs and namespaced secret slots; strict
  per-turn / thread-sticky selection with profile-isolated native-session
  resume; per-profile doctor probes and proactive per-profile subscription
  quota from the vendor oauth/usage endpoint; one typed profile policy per
  harness with provenance-recorded rotation on typed vendor-limit evidence
  only. Includes the unpublished 2.0.1 honest-engine and 2.0.2 simple-UI
  passes.

### Patch Changes

- 0fc050b: Credential profiles (INV-135): durable non-secret `credential_profiles`
  registry in the global config; the orchestrator resolves an explicit per-run
  profile id ONCE and stamps the typed profile on every HarnessRunSpec; adapters
  consume exactly the profile's transport (claude config-dir login / non-bare
  token / key; codex scoped CODEX_HOME / scoped auth.json; cursor, opencode,
  raw-api secret-ref keys) or refuse typed — never a fallback to default
  credentials. Namespaced secret slots (`claude_oauth:<profile>`), per-profile
  doctor probes (`GET /credential-profiles`, `claudexor profiles`), interactive
  `claudexor profiles login`, profile-stamped route evidence, and
  profile-isolated native-session resume.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Stabilize the checkpoint release with explicit reviewer-panel hardening, mandatory
  review evidence preflight, scoped Cursor reviewer readiness, frozen SpecPack gate
  merging, protected-path approvals, and thin control/macOS projection parity.
- Add `TaskContract.constraints.auto_protected_paths` so per-run approvals can
  narrow engine-derived gate/test protections without weakening spec/config-owned
  `protected_paths`.
