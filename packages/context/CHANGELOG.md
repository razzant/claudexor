### Patch Changes

- 8bae6ae: Credential-shaped text in your own work is no longer refused or masked (#555, INV-146 retires INV-062). A review brief, prompt, instruction, output schema, test command, live or deferred message, interaction answer or attachment that contains a bearer header, an `sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA` key, a JWT or a PEM block now reaches the selected harness exactly; the typed `inline_secret_rejected` error is gone from the CLI, `POST /v2/runs`, thread turns, MCP and ACP. The task contract, command journal, served job params, thread history, events, SSE frames, answers, plans, reports, retained output, saved `patch.diff` copies, reviewer packets, reviewer workspaces, context packs and served artifacts keep the exact bytes, so Exact Retry, Run Again, continuation and later turns read back what was sent, and reviewers judge the same patch apply uses. Files named `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/…`, `.ssh/…` or `.claude/…` inside the project are ordinary project files for context, review, directory results, uploads and served outputs; Codex approval requests for them are offered instead of declined, and `review --diff` no longer refuses a diff. Claude `AskUserQuestion` text is shown exactly and answered by its native question text. Tool calls keep unmasked targets (command, path, query, URL) within each adapter's existing bounds, and tool results keep unmasked summaries of their output (`content_summary`, and a failed tool's own `error_summary`, within each adapter's existing bound and whitespace normalization) for every adapter, a Cursor shell command whose end is unconfirmed keeps its complete native result (`native_result`) exactly, a failed raw-API completion keeps the model's bounded partial output (`partial_output`) exact in its error event while it stays a failure, never becomes the answer and the provider's error report stays masked, a Copilot ACP answer keeps credential-shaped text exact (only the managed token Claudexor injected is removed), a work report's required inputs stay exact in telemetry and run facts, a planner's own `plans/<harness>.md` copy is its exact text, and the gate argv disclosed to a candidate is the argv the gate runner executes. Images are no longer withheld from `produced/` or from served outputs for their bytes; an image Claudexor did not save (over the per-image or total size cap, unreadable, a link, not a regular file or an unsafe path) is listed in the attempt's `produced_omitted` with its size and reason, and the run summary names it. Credentials Claudexor itself owns stay in their stores, outside every worktree, behind daemon authentication, grants, read-only and trust policy, root and symlink containment and digest checks; engine diagnostics (errors, stderr tails, probe output, vendor failure reports, also inside the run, attempt and reviewer event journals, which all pass through one masking step) are still masked. Claudexor never places its engine credentials into prompts, events or artifacts; a harness process can read the credential the engine hands it, and whatever the harness prints is ordinary output kept exactly in local run records, as in the vendor's own transcript. Importing an arbitrary host file still refuses credential-store paths, and review risk still rates credential-named paths critical. The historical release-attestation sealer no longer refuses a reviewer report or metadata file for credential-shaped text: it still requires strict UTF-8, the digest and exact-key bindings and its other checks, and the attestation carries digests and validated fields, never report text. A real key you put in working content is ordinary task material: it reaches the selected model and stays in local run records. Runs written by earlier versions keep their masked copies; their `persisted_patch: redacted` patches still apply only from the private exact object (`patch_exact_bytes_unavailable` when it is missing), and the MCP read tools still project their `secretLike` disclosure, which is `null` for new runs.

  **Breaking:** `pr` delivery now needs the pinned open-source scanner Betterleaks 1.9.0 and checks what would leave the machine with it instead of Claudexor's own patterns; an npm-installed CLI bundles no scanner, so its `pr` refuses with `publication_scan_unavailable` until one is provided (below). Before any branch, index or ref changes, the exact outgoing commit, every earlier commit that a URL `git push origin` sends to (its push URL when one is set) does not already advertise, read with `git ls-remote` (a secret added and later deleted included, and a commit only the fetch URL or another remote holds still counts), what each merge in that range itself changed (Git's remerge view, Git 2.36 or newer: a conflict resolution or an "evil" merge, never content its parents already carried; an octopus merge has no such view and is scanned for what it adds over its first parent, which can re-flag content a non-first parent already published), the commit messages of that range, the branch name and the PR title and body are scanned with live validation off; the PR body `gh` reads is the scanned copy, and the push sends exactly the scanned commit object. A finding refuses typed (`publication_scan_findings`, rule and place only, never the matched text; a file name or label the scanner itself flags is shown as `withheld location (sha256 …)`, and every place is withheld when that check cannot run); a missing or unpinned scanner (`publication_scan_unavailable`) and a scan that fails, times out, writes no valid report or reads a Git history that Git's own trace2 record does not prove complete (every `git log` it ran exited 0 without a signal; a `git log` killed mid-stream otherwise looks clean) (`publication_scan_failed`) also refuse, and local apply, branch and commit stay available. The outgoing repository's own `.gitleaksignore`/`.betterleaksignore`, inline allow comments and scanner environment variables cannot suppress a finding. The macOS app and its update closure now bundle the darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64 builds and each SSH runtime archive bundles its own target's build, with the MIT license and provenance (the SBOMs list them). npm installs, and hosts on other platforms embedding the closure, bundle none for their platform: point `CLAUDEXOR_BETTERLEAKS_PATH` at the pinned build or provision it with `node scripts/provision-betterleaks.mjs`. Delivery never downloads it. Betterleaks skips some binary, archive and lockfile content by design, so a clean scan is not proof that nothing sensitive is present. Repository CI and release use the same adapter in place of the old `git grep` step, over the range's commits, merges and messages and the tracked tree; a release being published also scans its annotated tag's message.

- f428c0a: Raw API and OpenRouter requests judge an explicitly chosen model by what the catalog actually answered and send the material the project requires within that model's limits.

  - A model catalog that could not be read is no longer reported as proof that an explicit model does not exist. The read is typed (no credential, a rejected key on 401/403, another HTTP status, network, timeout, a malformed or partial answer, including a `total_count` that does not match the rows) and uses the same key as the run. When the catalog is only unavailable or unusable, the explicitly chosen model is sent unchanged on that same key and every place that admits it says once that it could not be verified: the settings read-back notes, the doctor's readiness detail, the run's status event and the reviewer panel's preflight event. A missing or rejected key still refuses with code `model_catalog_unavailable` (category `auth`): nothing is sent, the run records that typed failure rather than a crashed harness, and the settings write answers HTTP 409 with `cause` and `httpStatus`. A catalog that answered without the model still refuses it. A failed read in the middle of a run does not discard what that run already read with the same credentials, meaning the same account and the same key (a key replaced during the run counts as another credential): the earlier read still decides the model and sizes the request to its known window, and the run says so. `claudexor models`, `claudexor capabilities` and `GET /v2/harnesses/:id/models` report the failure instead of an empty list or a count of zero.
  - OpenRouter's routing variants `:nitro`, `:floor` and `:exacto` of a listed model are accepted in any order OpenRouter documents (`m:free:nitro` and `m:nitro:free` need `m:free` listed) and sent unchanged, with a note that `:nitro` and `:floor` may bill a service-tier rate. Undeclared suffixes still need the exact id listed, and `:online`, which would make OpenRouter search the web, is refused whether or not the catalog can be read. The models listing now carries the declared variants, so the app can find the listed row of a variant id.
  - Model rows now carry the catalog's input modalities and completion limit. An image attached for a model whose catalog lists no image input is still sent, with one note that the provider decides.
  - Raw API patch requests include the project's `context.mandatory_files` complete and honour `include`/`exclude`. Each request is sized from the catalog read that admits its model, made with the key that request uses, and the image note reuses that read; a key replaced while the request is being prepared is used from the next request on. A raw API reviewer, named in the reviewer panel or chosen by the automatic one, likewise sends the key its panel's catalog read checked. An Agent run with `attempts` or `untilClean` now sends a raw API route the same packet, mandatory files and patch protocol as a single attempt, instead of a bare prompt that could never return a patch. The whole request is sized to the selected model's known context window minus instructions, prompt, protocol, attachments and an answer allowance (approximate characters/4 estimates), optional files are omitted deterministically and disclosed, and mandatory content that cannot fit refuses before the request is sent. When the window is unknown the previous 200 000-token selection ceiling still applies and is labelled as an assumption. A patch cut at the provider's output limit is reported as truncated. The sizes are typed for every surface: the run summary's `rawContext` gives the estimate of the request the final attempt last prepared (recorded just before its POST) and the budget its packet honoured, and an over-window refusal's failure record carries `rawContextShortfall` with the window, the request's parts and every mandatory file's estimate, plus next actions. The macOS app shows the estimate and the omitted optional files as run facts, and the refusal with its largest mandatory files.

## 4.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 2593b90: On Windows, background harness runs and captures start the vendor with an invisible
  console instead of none, so the shells, `git`, MCP servers and other console programs
  a run starts inherit it instead of opening windows of their own. Agy keeps the
  console-less start because its print mode treats an openable console input as
  interactive, and Claudexor's own `git` calls keep the console-less start they always
  had.
  Cancellation still stops the whole tree with `taskkill /T`, and a background child
  now also ends when the daemon process dies. The no-Terminal sign-in
  children (URL disclosure and the device-code app-server) open no console window, and
  Codex quota and model discovery, the install version proof and the `login --help`
  probe start their direct child hidden. The Node preload that defaulted `windowsHide`
  inside npm wrappers is removed: the inherited console covers those children.

## 0.15.0

See the root CHANGELOG.md v0.15.0 entry (stabilization program release: concept freeze, model governance, run honesty, routing/output reality, per-commit review gate, MCP/ACP surface upgrade + integration suite).

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Stabilize the checkpoint release with explicit reviewer-panel hardening, mandatory
  review evidence preflight, scoped Cursor reviewer readiness, frozen SpecPack gate
  merging, protected-path approvals, and thin control/macOS projection parity.
- Refuse to persist raw `DIFF.patch` evidence when the candidate diff contains a
  secret-like token; reviewers fail closed before durable raw-secret artifacts are
  written.
